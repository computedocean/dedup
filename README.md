**Source**

$ go get -v github.com/jpillora/dedup
```

### Usage

```
$ dedup --help
```

<tmpl,code: dedup --help>
```

	Usage: dedup [options] <dir> [dir] [dir]

	Dedup de-deduplicates all directories, combines all dirs into
	the first <dir>, while removing duplicates.

	If two files having matching paths, the second file will be
	prefixed to the filename (if 'foo.txt' exists, the new file
	will be 'foo-2.txt').

	If you only specify one <dir> then only dedeplication will be
	performed.
	
	Options:
	  --keep, keep duplicates (by default, duplicates are deleted)
	  -v, verbose logs (display moves and deletes)

	Warnings:
	  * dedup is not recursive
	  * dedup is a destructive operation (unless --keep)
	  * any error will cause dedup to exit
