# dedeup

Deduplicate files

### Install

**Binaries**

See [Releases](https://github.com/jpillora/dedup/releases/latest)

**Source**

``` sh
$ go get -v github.com/jpillora/dedup
```

### Usage

```
$ dedup --help
```

<tmpl,code: dedup --help>
```

	Usage: dedup <destination> [source] [source]

	Dedup indexes and removes all duplicates from <destination> and
	then merges in all files from each [source] while deleting duplicates.
	If files are different, though they have the same name, a number will
	be prefixed to the filename (if 'foo.txt' exists, the new file will
	be 'foo-2.txt'). If you only specify a <destination> then only de-
	deplication will be performed.
